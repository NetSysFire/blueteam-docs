# blueteam Code of conduct

**Note:** This is still a draft and subject to change.

## Common sense

Do not discriminate others based on arbitrary factors which include, but are not limited to:

- Physical factors, such as skin color, age or origin
- Religion
- Used operating system
- Experience

We do not condone asking for help to do illegal activities. Helping with those inquiries will also result in a ban.
This is also prohibited via the [hackint FAQ](https://hackint.org/faq#What_kind_of_channels_are_allowed_on_hackint_Is_there_some_kind_of_ontopicofftopic_policy), these things are illegal in the specified countries.

## Language

The official language of the channel is English. Although we have many german-speaking people in the channel, try to keep it english so everyone can contribute to the discussion.

### Swearing

We are not a super strict environment suited for kids. Light, occasional swearing is allowed but excessive uses are not.

### Offtopic

A bit of offtopic here and there is completely alright, but avoid sensitive topics which include but are not limited to:

- Politics
  - We are aware of the fact that security has some topics with politics in common. The point of avoiding this topic is to not start potential flamewars.
- Religion
- Vulgar content

**NSFW (not safe for work) content is not allowed**.

## Help vampires

We are open to newbies asking questions, but please do not be a [help vampire](https://www.jasonwryan.com/blog/2012/03/17/vampires/). If you refuse to listen to advice and are otherwise annoying or needlessly draining the energy and resources of others, the channel operators will take action.

## Security

Since some people are reading this on their private devices, make sure any malicious urls are properly escaped, like this:

```
hxxps://my.malicious.url.attacker[.]tld
```

This also includes links to any malicious executable files.

## Enforcement

If you violate these rules, you may be temporarily or permanently banned. For lesser violations, the former will be preferred and the channel operators will decide if a warning alone will suffice.
